Crafted a sophisticated API rate limiter leveraging Python Flask, designed to regulate incoming requests from clients. This project embodies a crucial aspect of modern web development, addressing scalability, security, and performance concerns through intelligent rate limiting strategies.

Key Features:

Advanced Rate Limiting Logic: Engineered a dynamic RateLimiter class employing efficient data structures and algorithms to enforce strict rate limits based on client IP addresses and time intervals, ensuring optimal resource utilization and fair access to the API.

Scalable Architecture: Designed with scalability in mind, the rate limiter is capable of handling a high volume of concurrent requests while maintaining responsiveness and stability, making it suitable for deployment in production environments.

RESTful API Endpoints: Developed RESTful API endpoints using Flask, aligning with industry best practices for building robust and interoperable web services, facilitating seamless integration with existing systems and client applications.

Configurability and Customization: Empowered users with the ability to fine-tune rate limiting parameters such as maximum requests per interval (max_requests) and time window duration (interval), enabling flexible adaptation to diverse traffic patterns and application requirements.
